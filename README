This is a try of making a module for APP inventor for the android development subject final delivery.

I will implement a basic GATT profile with a service discover and characteristics discover/enabler in order to get notifications.

So other profiles are not implemented.

Currently, the appinventor implement bluetooth 2.0 RFCOMM (serial port simulation) profile so it is useless for new embedded bluetooth 4.0 low energy devices.

This is the main motivation of making this module.

In order to compile you need Java sdk 1.7 64 bits (because 1.8 fails and you need 1848m heap , so it is necessary to be 64bits).
